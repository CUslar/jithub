# Jithub

Jithub is a simple Clojure library for interacting with the Github API.

## Examples

```clojure
(:use jithub.core)
(:require [jithub.repos.downloads :as dl])

(def repo { :user "foo"
            :name "repo_name"
            :password "secret" })

; Wrap with repo to access
(with-repo repo

    ; List all downloads for a repo
    (dl/all)

    ; Fetch a specific download by ID
    (dl/show 12345)

    ; Create a new download
    (dl/create "/path/to/file" "name" "description")

    ; Delete a download
    (dl/delete 12345)

)
```

## Responses

At the moment methods that request JSON will have that returned as Clojure data
structures, and where that doesn't make sense the response map is returned (with
headers and such).

## Current Scope

This code was extracted from part of another project as it might be useful, but this
is not a complete API implementation.  Only downloads so far :)
